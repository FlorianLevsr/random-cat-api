# random-cat-api

Tiny API which sends a random cat picture. /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\

Required tools:

- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sqitch

## Quick start

The ```.env``` and ```sqitch.conf``` files are required in order to start the app. Get inspired by the ```example_ones``` already available.

```bash
npm install 
sqitch status 
sqitch deploy
npm run start
```

Feel free to run it as a dev, thanks to ```npm run dev``` (in this case, nodemon must be installed: ```sudo npm install -g nodemon```).
